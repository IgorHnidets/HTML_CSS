<h1> Shevchenko Taras Hrygorovych</h1>
<hr>
<p><b>Taras Hryhorovych Shevchenko</b>(9 March [O.S. 25 February] 1814 – 10 March [O.S. 26 February] 1861), also known as <b>Kobzar Taras</b>, or simply Kobzar (a kobzar is a
    bard in Ukrainian culture), was a Ukrainian poet, writer, artist, public and political figure, folklorist and ethnographer.[4][6][7] His literary heritage is
    regarded to be the foundation of modern Ukrainian literature and, to a large extent, the modern Ukrainian language though it is different from the language of
    his poems. <br><br>Shevchenko is also known for his many masterpieces as a painter and an illustrator.[6] </p>

<h2>Life</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Childhood and youth</h3>
<p>Taras Shevchenko was born on 9 March [O.S. 25 February] 1814[Note b] in the village of Moryntsi, Zvenyhorodka county, Kyiv Governorate, Russian Empire (today Zvenyhorodka Raion,
Ukraine). He was the third child after his sister Kateryna[10] and brother Mykyta,[10] in family of serf peasants Hryhoriy Ivanovych Shevchenko (1782?–1825) and Kateryna Yakymivna
Shevchenko (Boiko) (1782? – 6 August 1823), both of whom were owned by landlord Vasily Engelhardt. According to the family legends, Taras's forefathers were Cossacks who served in
the Zaporozhian Host and had taken part in the Cossack uprisings of the 17th and 18th centuries. Those uprisings were brutally suppressed in Cherkasy, Poltava, Kyiv, Bratslav, and
Chernihiv disrupting normal social life for many years afterwards. Most of the local population were then enslaved and reduced to poverty.<br><br>
In 1816, the Shevchenko family moved back to the village of Kyrylivka (today Shevchenkove) in Zvenyhorodka county, where Taras' father, Hryhoriy Ivanovych, had been born.[11] Taras
spent his childhood years in the village. On May 24 [O.S. May 12] 1816, Taras' sister Yaryna was born,[12] and on 7 February [O.S. 26 January] 1819—Maria.[13] Once, young Taras went
looking for "the iron pillars that hold up the sky" and got lost. Chumaks who met the boy took him with him to Kyrylivka.[Note c][14][15] On 20 March [O.S. 8 March] 1821 Taras' brother Yosyp was born.[16]
<br><br>In the fall of 1822, Taras started to take grammar classes at a local precentor (dyak) Sovhyr.[17][18] At that time, Shevchenko became familiar with Hryhoriy Skovoroda's works. During
1822-1828 Shevchenko painted horses and soldiers.[19]
    <br><br>
On 10 February [O.S. 29 January] 1823 his older sister and nanny Kateryna married Anton Krasytskyi, a serf "from Zelena Dibrova". On 1 September [O.S. 20 August] 1823 Taras' hard working
mother died, leaving six children - three sons and three daughters, including the just-married eldest.[20][21][22] Only a month later, on 19 October [O.S. 7 October] 1823 his father
married a widow, Oksana Tereshchenko, a native of Moryntsi village, who already had three children of her own.[Note d][20][23] She treated her step-children, and particularly little
Taras, with great cruelty.[Note e] On July 4 [O.S. June 22] 1824 Taras's half-sister Maria from the second marriage of Hryhoriy Ivanovych was born.[24] In 1824, Taras, along with his father
, became a traveling merchant (chumak) and traveled to Zvenyhorodka, Uman, Yelizavetgrad (today Kropyvnytskyi).[25]
At the age of eleven, Taras became an orphan when, on 2 April [O.S. 21 March] 1825, his father died as a serf in corvée.[22][26][27][28] Soon his stepmother, along with her children, returned to Moryntsi.
Taras was sent to work for precentor (dyak) Bohorsky who had just arrived from Kyiv in 1824.[29][30]
    <br><br> As an apprentice, Taras carried water, heated up a school, served the precentor,
read psalms over the dead and continued to study.[17][31] At that time Shevchenko became familiar with some works of Ukrainian literature. Soon, tired of Bohorsky's long term mistreatment,
Shevchenko escaped in search of a painting master in the surrounding villages.[31] For several days he worked for deacon Yefrem in Lysianka,[31][32] later in other places around in southern
part of Kyiv Governorate (villages Stebliv and Tarasivka).[32][33][34] In 1827 Shevchenko was herding community sheep near his village. He then met Oksana Kovalenko, a childhood friend, whom
    Shevchenko mentions in his works on multiple occasions. He dedicated the introduction of his poem "Mariana, the Nun" to her.[35][36]</p>

<h2>Out of serfdom</h2>
<p>In Saint Petersburg Shevchenko met Ukrainian artist Ivan Soshenko, who introduced him to other compatriots such as Yevhen Hrebinka and Vasyl Hryhorovych, and to Russian painter Alexey Venetsianov.
    Through these men Shevchenko also met famous painter and professor Karl Briullov, who donated his portrait of Russian poet Vasily Zhukovsky as a lottery prize. Its proceeds were used to buy Shevchenko's
    freedom on 5 May 1838.[26]</p>
<h2>Family</h2>
<p>Shevchenko never married. He had six siblings and at least three step-siblings, of whom only Stepan Tereshchenko (1820?–unknown) is known. Some sources connect him to the Tereshchenko family of Ukrainian industrialists</p>
